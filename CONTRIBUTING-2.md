# Creating co-authored commits on GitHub
https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors

After you've made changes in a file using the web editor on GitHub, you can create a co-authored commit by adding a `Co-authored-by`: trailer to the commit's message.

1. Collect the name and email address for each co-author. If a person chooses to keep their email address private, you should use their GitHub-provided `no-reply` email to protect their privacy.
2. After making your changes together, at the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the changes you made.

3. In the text box below your commit message, add `Co-authored-by: name <name@example.com>` with specific information for each co-author. If you're adding multiple co-authors, give each co-author their own line and `Co-authored-by`: commit trailer.

4. Click Commit changes or Propose changes.

The new commit and message will appear on GitHub.
